## 📍 Conclusions

- The age group 31 to 40 seems to be the most prominent, as the number of customers in this group is higher compared to the other age groups.​  
- The age group 61 to 70 makes up the highest proportion of total purchases among all other age groups.​  
- Customers are evenly distributed across all regions.​  
- The spending behavior of people aged 70 seems to be the most prominent, as they spend the most on our products.​  
- Males from the North region and Others from the East region contribute more to the total revenue in their respective regions.​  
- There is no skewness across categories, and purchases in the Home and Kitchen category are the highest.​  
- January, June, and October make more purchases compared to the other months. Therefore, the inventory should be maintained accordingly.​

## 💡 Recommendation

- Focus marketing on age groups 31–40 and 61–70, especially targeting high spenders aged 70+.  
- Tailor regional promotions, particularly for males in the North and 'Others' in the East.  
- Stock more Home & Kitchen products and prepare inventory ahead of January, June, and October.  
- Maintain balanced regional logistics and continue monitoring category trends.
